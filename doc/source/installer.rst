Installing Python
=================

Now, instructions on how to install Python from the ``Ansys Python Manager`` are provided.

In order to do so, just follow the upcoming steps:

#. Search for the ``Ansys Python Manager`` and run it.

#. Go to the ``Install Python`` tab, and select your desired Python install, version and extra packages.

#. And follow the install process.


Configurable options for the installer
--------------------------------------

Two Python options for installation are available:

* ``Standard``: this mode installs the standard Python version from `python.org <https://www.python.org/>`_
* ``Conda (miniforge)``: this mode installs the Python version from `miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_.
  This install is characterized for being a modified ``conda`` install in which you have access to the ``conda``
  package manager through the ``conda-forge`` channel.

Regarding the available Python versions, users can select among the following ones:

* Python 3.8
* Python 3.9
* Python 3.10
* Python 3.11
* Python 3.12

.. collapse:: Linux : Python installation

    1. Conda python installation:

      #. Bash scripts will be downloaded and executed on a machine directly from the official website.(https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#unix-like-platforms-mac-os--linux).

    2. Standard python installation happens in two ways:

      #. If the Debian version is 22.04 and Python 3.11 (recommended by Ansys) is specified, the installer will automatically install the pre-compiled version of Python available within the installer.

      #. Otherwise, Python will be installed following these steps:

        #. Download Python Tarball and Untar:

          i. The Python tar file will be downloaded from the Python FTP server (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/) based on the version selected from the dropdown menu. Example: For Python version 3.8.11, the download link would be here(https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.11/Python-3.8.11.tar.xz).

          ii.  Decompress the downloaded file in the userâ€™s cache directory.

        * Configure the Source:

          i. Following will be executed configure the installation:

            .. code:: shell
              ./configure --prefix=~/.local/ansys/{python_folder_name}
        * Build and install Python:

          i. Build and install Python using the make and make install commands.


.. warning::

  In the case of having selected ``Conda (miniforge)``, only Python 3.10 is available.


Managing Python environments
============================

Through the ``Ansys Python Manager``, users can also have access to their different Python
installations. Have a look at how to access it here:

#. Search for the ``Ansys Python Manager`` and run it.

#. Access the ``Manage Python Environments`` tab.

#. Select your desired ``Python`` environment and start one of the listed options.


On the ``Launching options`` section, the following options are available:

* ``Launch Console``: this option starts a console window with the command ``python`` pointing
  towards your selected Python environment.
* ``Launch JupyterLab``: this option starts a ``JupyterLab`` session. If ``JupyterLab`` is
  not installed, then the ``Ansys Python Manager`` installs it for you.
* ``Launch Jupyter Notebook``: this option starts a ``Jupyter Notebook`` session. If
  ``Jupyter Notebook`` is not installed, then the ``Ansys Python Manager`` installs it for you.
* ``Launch Spyder``: this option starts a Spyder IDE session. If Spyder is not installed,
  then the ``Ansys Python Manager`` installs it for you.

On the ``Package management`` section, the following options are available:

* ``Install Python default packages``: by selecting this option, your selected Python install
  receives the latest compatible versions for ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``pandas``, ``matplotlib``
  and  ``scikit-learn``.
* ``Install PyAnsys``: by selecting this option, your selected Python install has access to
  the latest, compatible PyAnsys metapackage installation. This metapackage provides you with
  access to the latest public PyAnsys libraries in their compatible version with the latest
  Ansys products.
* ``List installed packages``: by selecting this option, a list of the installed packages on
  your selected Python install is provided. This might be useful for identifying potential problems.
