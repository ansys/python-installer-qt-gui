Contributing
============

We absolutely welcome any code contributions and we hope that this
guide will facilitate an understanding of the ``ansys-tools-installer`` code
repository. It is important to note that while the ``ansys-tools-installer`` software
package is maintained by ANSYS and any submissions will be reviewed
thoroughly before merging, we still seek to foster a community that can
support user questions and develop new features to make this software
a useful tool for all users. As such, we welcome and encourage any
questions or submissions to this repository.

For contributing to this project, please refer to the
`PyAnsys Developer's Guide`_.
